# [project Project]

[project Project] is a collaborative and interactive project management application. It was ideated in two hours, planned in a day, then developed within the span of 11 days by four full-stack Javascript students as part of the winter 2023 class from the School of Applied Learning and Technology, aka Salt.

## Tech Stack
We built this project in TypeScript. The following tools/services were used:
- NextJS v.13 (and NextAPI)
- FireBase Auth
- Firebase 
- FireStore (for storage of pictures)
- Bing Image API

## Improvements

Following the completion of the 11 day sprint, we have added the following features:

We hope to continue improving and tweaking this project in the future and may look at the following areas (as well as any others we may think of).
